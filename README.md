# Warehouse Optimization for 3PL Delivery Partners (Goa, India)

This project applies **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** to optimize warehouse locations for last-mile delivery operations in Goa. It simulates real-world logistics for an Amazon-style network using real geographic and cost data.

---

## Problem Statement
Identify the best combination of warehouses that:
- Minimize overall delivery and setup costs
- Stay within a 40 km delivery radius
- Include staffing and rental overheads
- Account for multiple delivery truck types

---

## Tools & Techniques
- Python with **PuLP** (MILP Solver)
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- Excel/CSV for cost matrices and demand data
